# Constellar
Experimental MC 1.8.9 PvP client that isn't necessarily focused only on Hypixel (unheard of).

# Contributing
Just PR lol.

# Building
1. Clone
2. Open with a competent IDE (IntelliJ). Ensure anything less than Gradle 5 is being used (provided in `gradle` folder).
3. Run `gradle setupDecompWorkspace`
4. Run `gradle genIntellijRuns` if you're on IntelliJ as it allows for building.
5. You should be good to go.
